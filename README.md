# Observer-01: The Future of Vision Engineering

**A Transcendental Vision Framework** This system represents the first stage of a methodological evolution in image processing, bridging the gap between current cognitive logic and future-ready architectures.

## Current Phase: Logic Foundations
- **Modular Core:** High-efficiency processing pipelines.
- **Realism Engine:** Advanced logic for cinematic metadata generation.
- **Structure:** Scalable environment for future vision integration.

*Status: Architecture Stabilized. Logic Simulation: Active.*
